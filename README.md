<h1>Grocery List #2</h1>

This project shows a second variation of the grocery list. There are two containers; each with specific functionality.
First, upper container contains form and input tag, where user can insert grocery (input value). When this is done, an alert
will appear at the top of container, saying the grocery is successfully added.

The value will appear in the ul list in the second container. Groceries can be easily removed, either all at once or one by one,
by clicking on the "Clear Items" button, or by clicking on the small trash icon, positioned to th right of the item value(grocery).
In either case an alert will appear that the item(s) are removed successfully. When there's no grocery(ies) to remove anymore,Å¾
warning alert will appear and the disappear.

CSS variables were used for things like primary color, cursor etc. Media queries added only for devices with size smaller than
450px and 400px.
